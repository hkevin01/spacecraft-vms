# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously for all components of the Spacecraft VMS. Currently supported versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| develop | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT: Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

For mission-critical and safety-related vulnerabilities, please follow this process:

### Critical Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability that could:
- Compromise spacecraft safety
- Lead to mission failure
- Expose sensitive mission data
- Allow unauthorized access to spacecraft systems

Please report immediately via:
- Email: security@spacecraft-vms.org (if available)
- Private GitHub Security Advisory
- Direct message to maintainers

### Standard Security Issues

For other security concerns:
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Include potential impact assessment

## Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Response within 24 hours
- **High severity**: Response within 72 hours
- **Medium/Low severity**: Response within 1 week

## Vulnerability Assessment Criteria

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation in flight software
- Safety system bypass
- Mission data exposure

### High
- Local privilege escalation
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service affecting critical systems

### Medium
- Cross-site scripting in ground tools
- Information leakage (non-critical)
- Local denial of service

### Low
- Minor information disclosure
- Non-exploitable bugs with security implications

## Security Measures

### Development
- Static analysis integrated in CI/CD
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code review required for all changes
- Automated security testing

### Deployment
- Secure boot implementation
- Encrypted communications
- Access control and authentication
- Regular security updates

### Monitoring
- Runtime security monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Security event logging
- Incident response procedures

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- Use secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Handle errors securely
- Avoid hardcoded secrets
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication

### For Users
- Keep systems updated
- Use strong authentication
- Monitor security logs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular security assessments

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure:

1. Report the vulnerability privately
2. Allow reasonable time for fixes
3. Coordinate public disclosure timing
4. Credit security researchers appropriately

## Security Tools

We use these tools for security assurance:

- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL, Semgrep, cppcheck
- **Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot, Trivy
- **Runtime Protection**: AddressSanitizer, Valgrind
- **Fuzzing**: AFL++, libFuzzer
