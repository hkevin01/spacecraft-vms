# Architecture

This repository scaffolds a Vehicle Management System (VMS) spanning:
- Firmware: FreeRTOS on MCU + POSIX/SIL build for host testing.
- High-level compute: ROS 2 nodes and tools.
- Simulation: Basilisk scenarios with a ROS 2 bridge.

See safety_case.md, interfaces.md, and test_plan.md for details.
